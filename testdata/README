This directory contains:

 - a bunch of .txt files

    These are "session files". Each one is a record of a single invocation of godebug. endtoend_cli_test.go, in the directory above,
    compiles runs one godebug session for each file in this directory, checking that godebug's behavior matches exactly.
    "cmd" is the command line invocation for that particular test.
    "dir" is the working directory, relative to the test-filesystem/ directory.

 - test-filesystem/

    This is the working directory where endtoend_cli_test.go runs its tests. The test sets GOPATH=test-filesystem/gopath:$GOPATH before running.


 - single-file-tests/

    See the README in that directory. It contains similar test files, used by endtoend_test.go.
