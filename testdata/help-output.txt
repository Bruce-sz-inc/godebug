// cmd: godebug help output

usage: godebug output [-w] <packages>

Output outputs debugging code for <packages>.

By default, output will print the resulting code to stdout.
If the -w flag is given, output will overwrite the original
source files. Use with caution.

<packages> may take one of two forms:

    1. A list of *.go source files.

       All of the specified files are loaded, parsed and type-checked
       as a single package.  All the files must belong to the same directory.

    2. A list of import paths, each denoting a package.

       The package's directory is found relative to the $GOROOT and
       $GOPATH using similar logic to 'go build', and the *.go files in
       that directory are loaded, parsed and type-checked as a single
       package.

       In addition, all *_test.go files in the directory are then loaded
       and parsed.  Those files whose package declaration equals that of
       the non-*_test.go files are included in the primary package.  Test
       files whose package declaration ends with "_test" are type-checked
       as another package, the 'external' test package, so that a single
       import path may denote two packages.
