// cmd: godebug help run

usage: godebug run [-instrument pkgs...] gofiles... [arguments...]

Run is a wrapper around 'go run'. It generates debugging code for
the named Go source files and runs 'go run' on the result.

By default, godebug generates debugging code only for the named
Go source files, and not their dependencies. This means that in
the debugging session you will not be able to step into function
calls from imported packages. To instrument other packages,
pass the -instrument flag. Packages are comma-separated and
must not be relative.
